ScanEvrythng
============

A simple application which allows a user to scan everyday items which are then uploaded via the Evrythng API. The app hooks into the Scandit SDK to scan barcodes and uses the community licenced API to get basic details about a barcode (currently just name and category). The scan results are enhanced with geolocation information and then uploaded to the Evrythng API. The current list of Thngs in the user account can also be listed.
